# 🚀 Aryan Gupta  

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my little corner of the universe. I’m **Aryan Gupta**, a 16-year-old living life (and riding bikes) in the beautiful state of Florida, United States! 🚴‍♂️

## 🌟 **Who Am I?**  
Let’s break it down:  
- 🎯 **Purpose-Driven**: I believe life is a mix of divine destiny and personal choices—God wrote most of my story, but I’ve got the pen now, and I’m crafting the plot twist!  
- 🚴‍♂️ **Bike Enthusiast**: Whether it’s a joyride or a mental reset, biking clears my mind like nothing else.  
- 🤗 **Friend First**: I’ll always show up for my friends, even if I’m down. Call me the *"Advice Guy"* who could probably use his own advice!  
- 💭 **Big Reflector**: Mistakes? Been there, done that, and learned a lot. Sure, I wish I had a time machine 🕰️, but growth is the real flex.

## ⚡ **My Superpowers**  
- 🛠️ Turning struggles into lessons (sometimes with a side of regret 🫠).  
- 💬 Giving thoughtful advice that helps others shine.  
- 🚵‍♀️ Finding freedom on two wheels.

## 🎉 **Fun Facts About Me**  
- I believe life is like a **choose-your-own-adventure book** 📖. Sure, some parts are pre-written, but I’m here to make the exciting choices!  
- Self-confidence? Still a work-in-progress. But hey, progress is progress, right?  
- I prioritize my friends so much, it’s like a second full-time job! 💼❤️
- I love to be out doors go biking, running, talking a walk, etc.🌲🌳🌴
- I am well organized (life gets messy sometimes but then fix it back up 🤗).
